# (Possible) FAQs

## Ok, but why?
You may be asking "Why create a coding repository for things that are either included on the program I use (like CodeHS) or that is a quick Google Search away?"

The reason is simple: These are often not all in one place. And, when they are, they are often not broken up enough to make it easy to read or digest. This repository exists to provide both an easy read, as well as streamline it into one, local, and easy to access file.

## What languages will be included?
As of now, I only know the basics of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Naturally, these languages will be included at the level I know them at. So, if your favorite tag in HTML is not included, then I simply do not know it or don't find it necessary. Sorry :(

Additionally, I have some coding nerds as frinds (listed at the end) that may contribute some languages that they want to. One of my friends (@WC-III) has started to build a C# page, if you're interested. 

So, to answer the question, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and any other language, but the first three are the first priority.

## How much experience do you, the author, have?

Very little. I started coding in August of 2024 and know the barebones of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through CodeHS and Code.org.

## Why are writing styles inconsistent between different languages?

Odds are, they were written by different people. For example, the JavaScript page is going to be written differently than the C# page, because @WC-III wrote the C# page while I wrote the JS one.
