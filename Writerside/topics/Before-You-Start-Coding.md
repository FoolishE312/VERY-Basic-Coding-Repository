# Before You Start Coding
Many people think coding is hard. Maybe because it is a time committment. Maybe because it's like learning a new language. Maybe because they just haven't tried to learn. Regardless of their reasoning, they never try. And, therefore, don't realize just how easy it is.

This often dissuades new learners, regardless of if they have any interest in learning in the first place. But the fact of the matter is that coding is VERY easy to learn once you have an open mind. 

If you're reading this, then you're likely interested in coding, if not already in a coding class. Regardless, it is often hard to remember all of the tags/properties/commands that one could possibly need for languages. This is especially true for beginners. 

This repository works to help bridge the gap - even if just a little - between the basics of programming languages and new learners.
