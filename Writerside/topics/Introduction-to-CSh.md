# Introduction to C#
C# was developed by Microsoft to be a human-readable sidegrade to Java.
The two are *very* similar, and if you know one, you probably know the other.

## Getting Started
Since C# is so universal, you've got a definitive program to use it - Microsoft's Visual Studio.
For my linux people, use VS Code instead with a few extensions, unless you *really* know how to use WINE.

## Differences
C# runs the back of most Windows applications you'll find, and there are way too many variations of how to use it, but here are the main four:

<tab id="was" title="WAS Projects">

WAS (Windows App SDK) is the successor to UWP and WPF.
It isn't fully released yet to all windows versions, but [here's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wasdk?view=vs-2022&tabs=vs-2022-17-10) how.

<tab id="uwp" title="UWP Projects">

UWP (Universal Windows Platform) is the successor to WPF and is the predecessor to WAS.
I've never used it, but [here's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-uwp?view=vs-2022) a start.

<tab id="wpf" title="WPF Projects">

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is the predecessor to both UWP and WAS
I've used it only a little bit, so there's online researching to do.
If I feel like it, i'll put more here.

<tab id="console" title="Console Projects">

A Console-line program will be the focus of the C# guide for now.
It's what I'm the most familiar in, and it's just raw C#, no XAML needed.

The last little bit, nearly everything will require a semicolon at the end of it, excluding loops and braces.
