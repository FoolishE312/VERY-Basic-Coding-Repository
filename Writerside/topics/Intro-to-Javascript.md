# Intro to Javascript

**JavaScript** (commonly abbreviated as **JS**) is one of three main languages that websites are built upon, alongside HTML and CSS. 
While HMTL and CSS are mostly used to build the structure of websites, JS is used for other functions, such as making webpages more interactive and printing more complex text. 

JS is able to complete math computations using Constants and Variables, and can display results on the screen for the user as well. 

> IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Java and JavaScript are **NOT** the same language, although they are slightly similar. Java is used to create applications, while JavaScript is used for webpages.
