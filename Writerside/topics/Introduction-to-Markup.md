# Introduction to Markup

Markup is two things: markdown, and semantic markup.
And yet, they are very similar, with both of them usually falling under the same roof.
For reference, these pages are written in Markup, so these are for the contributors.
Or for people who are trying to escape HTML, but I don't judge.
