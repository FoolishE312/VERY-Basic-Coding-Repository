> This is a Thank You page for everyone who has helped me with my coding journey thus far. (Note: This list is not finalized and will likely be added onto.)

First of all, I'd like to thank God with providing me with the opportunity to creat this repository to help new coders. While He may not have written code, He is still a big part of my life and deserves to be recognized as such.

Second, I'd like to thank CodeHS and Code.org with providing the materials that I used to learn how to code. It is safe to say that I would not have had the ability nor desire to learn if not for their wonderful resources. 

Third, I have to thank my good friend @WC-III. He included all of the base code necessary for me to get started writing this repository, and has been very helpful with finding my mistakes in the repository's code.
