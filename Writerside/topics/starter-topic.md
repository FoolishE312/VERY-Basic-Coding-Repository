Hello and welcome to the coding repository!

The three main programming languages included in this repository will each get their own sections: HTML, CCS, and JavaScript.
From there, it will be broken up in sections of relavancy, like "Mathery," "Graphics," "Tables," etc. 
Obviously, each language will have a different length of topics and subjects, all depending on what I know and the like.
Also, not every type of HTML tag, CSS property, and JavaScript command will be represented here. These are just the basics that I know and a good baseline to get started
