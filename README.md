# VERY-Basic-Coding-Repository
Hi there! This repository is neither extensive, nor advanced. But, if you're just starting to code, it may help you with some basics. This repository will have some basic coding structures (Primarily in JavaScript and HTML/CSS) and some tips and tricks I've learned while doing this myself. Enjoy!

## Ok, But Why?
You may be asking "Why create a coding repository for things that are either included on the program I use (like CodeHS) or that is a quick Google Search away?"

The reason is simple: These are often not all in one place. And, when they are, they are often not broken up enough to make it easy to read or digest. This repository exists to provide both an easy read, as well as streamline it into one, local, and easy to access file.
