# VERY-Basic-Coding-Repository
Hi there! This repository is neither extensive, nor advanced. But, if you're just starting to code, it may help you with some basics. This repository will have some basic coding structures (Primarily in JavaScript and HTML/CSS) and some tips and tricks I've learned while doing this myself. Enjoy!

# (Possible) FAQs

## Ok, But Why?
You may be asking "Why create a coding repository for things that are either included on the program I use (like CodeHS) or that is a quick Google Search away?"

The reason is simple: These are often not all in one place. And, when they are, they are often not broken up enough to make it easy to read or digest. This repository exists to provide both an easy read, as well as streamline it into one, local, and easy to access file.

## What Languages Will Be Included?
As of now, I only know the basics of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Naturally, these languages will be included at the level I know them at. So, if your favorite tag in HTML is not included, then I simply do not know it or don't find it necessary. Sorry :(

Additionally, I have some coding nerds as frinds (listed at the end) that may contribute some languages that they want to, such as C#. 

So, to answer the question, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other language, but the first three are the first priority.
