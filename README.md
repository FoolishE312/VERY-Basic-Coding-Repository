# VERY-Basic-Coding-Repository
Hi there! This repository is neither extensive, nor advanced. But, if you're just starting to code, it may help you with some basics. This repository will have some basic coding structures (Primarily in JavaScript and HTML/CSS) and some tips and tricks I've learned while doing this myself. Enjoy!

##Ok, But Why?
You may be asking "Why create a coding repository for things that are either included on the program I use (like CodeHS) or that is a quick Google Search away?"
